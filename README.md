# F# By Example
F# By Example is a site that is designed for quickly learning or referencing the core features of the F# language. It is largely inspired by sites like [GoByExample](https://gobyexample.com).

It is best suited for programmers already well versed with similar languagues who want to learn it from scratch, or for use as a quick reference for those already reasonably comfortable with the core features of the lanaugage.
